In  the following sentence, there is one underlinedd word and gap. From the list of words lettered A to D, choose the one that is most nearly opposite in meaning to the underlinedd words and that will, at the same time correctly fill the gap in the sentence.  
<br>
###EXPLAN###
Prohibited is the answer. It is the only option that has a legal or official angle to its meaning. Prohibited and permitted have formal connotations. Unaccepted may refer to a way of life or attitude, licensed is similar not opposite in meaning while Suspended indicates something temporary.

###EXPLAN###
Unknown is the answer. Humble will go with arrogant. Although, infamous sounds like the opposite but they both mean almost the same thing, only in different ways. While famous has a positive connotation, infamous has a negative one. Unpopular is about public acceptance and being famous is about recognition not acceptance.

These kinds of questions are known as question tags. For question tags, the second part of the sentence must employ the same verbal elements used in the first part of the sentence. In this case it is �will�. This eliminates options A, B and D. The verbs used must also contrast the state of the verbs. If the first is positive, the second must be negative. �will� is positive, therefore the answer must be negative. This leaves us with C as the correct answer which can also be written as �will not it�.
Question tags are a peculiar set because the preceding verb must be used in the tag succeeding the statement. So in this case, will is used and so the answer is option C
